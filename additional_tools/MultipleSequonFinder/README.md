# Multiple Sequon Finder

This tool was designed to determine which influenza strains specific N-linked glycosylation sequons arose in, so that the strains preceeding them could be tested in the program Future Sequon Finder.
This approach was used primarily when analyzing swine influenza strains, whose glycosylation patterns have been
less rigorously studied than their human counterparts.

## System Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or later (tested with JDK 21)
- No external libraries required
