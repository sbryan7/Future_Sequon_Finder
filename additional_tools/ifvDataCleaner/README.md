# IFV Data Cleaner

This tool was used to collect and clean nucleotide sequences for mutation frequency analysis
in Future Sequon Finder. Specifically, this tool was designed to filter influenza virus hemagglutinin sequences from large 
datasets acquired from the Bioinformatics Resource Center and GISAID's EpiFlu database based on the year they were
acquired, the length of the acquired sequence, and the number of insertions or deletions in the sequence relative to other hemagglutinin sequences.
All sequences must be added in FASTA format. 

## System Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or later (tested with JDK 21)
- No external libraries required
